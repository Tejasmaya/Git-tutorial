Unstaging & Unmodifying Files In Git | Git Tutorials #12

git restore --staged <file name> :- Unstage file which are not commited


//if we mistakenly change something from a file we can restore the file to its previous version and unmodify it 
git checkout -- <file name>       
git checkout -f          // simply rollback to the last commit 
// we should be careful using this as we will lose all progress made after using this command
